# 😃 Hello, Welcome to my Github!
I am a back-end Software Engineer focused on building scalable, well-structured systems that are easy to maintain and evolve. I enjoy turning complex business rules into clean, organized, and sustainable software solutions.

I primarily work with .NET / C# and SQL Server, contributing across the full development cycle — from architecture and domain modeling to delivering new features in production environments.

I am constantly learning new technologies and improving how I design and build softwares
